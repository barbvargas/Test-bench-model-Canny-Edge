I believe the output is correct I am not sure if the diff section is supposed to be there 
all the Engineering%03d_edges.pgm were produced and my module visualiztion showed correct 
module and channel connections. I had a hard time figuring out how to connect the port
from a parent module so I bound data ins port with the platform in port and none of the 
images were produced, once I used the -> symbol to access read it worked. I had this 
same issue with data out. I also struggled on where to put the channel constructor with the 
size. Finally I accidentally put sc_stops in the infinite loops so I was getting only 28 
edge images for a while but once they were removed it worked.
